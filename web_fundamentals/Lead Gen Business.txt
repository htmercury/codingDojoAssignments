1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?
SELECT billing_id, SUM(amount) FROM billing

WHERE EXTRACT(month FROM charged_datetime) = 3 AND EXTRACT(year FROM charged_datetime) = 2012;

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?
SELECT billing_id, SUM(amount) FROM billing

JOIN clients ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id

WHERE clients.client_id = 2;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?
SELECT domain_name, clients.client_id FROM sites

JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

WHERE clients.client_id=10;

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?
SELECT clients.client_id, COUNT(site_id) as number_of_websites, MONTHNAME(created_datetime) as month_created, YEAR(created_datetime) as year_created FROM sites

JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

WHERE clients.client_id=1

GROUP BY month_created, year_created;

SELECT clients.client_id, COUNT(site_id) as number_of_websites, MONTHNAME(created_datetime) as month_created, YEAR(created_datetime) as year_created FROM sites

JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

WHERE clients.client_id=20
GROUP BY month_created, year_created;

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?
SELECT domain_name , COUNT(leads.leads_id), DATE_FORMAT(registered_datetime, '%M %d, %Y') as date_generated FROM leads
JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' AND registered_datetime <= '2011/02/15'

GROUP BY sites.site_id;

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads FROM leads

JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

WHERE registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' AND registered_datetime <= '2011/12/31'

GROUP BY clients.client_id;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads, MONTHNAME(registered_datetime) as month_generated FROM leads

JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

WHERE registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' AND registered_datetime <= '2011/06/30'

GROUP BY client_name, month_generated;

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, domain_name as website, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads, DATE_FORMAT(registered_datetime, '%M %d, %Y') AS date_generated FROM leads

JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

WHERE registered_datetime >= '2011/01/01' AND registered_datetime <= '2011/12/31'

GROUP BY clients.client_id, website;

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, domain_name as website, COUNT(leads.leads_id) as number_of_leads FROM leads

JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id

JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id

GROUP BY clients.client_id, website;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, SUM(amount), MONTHNAME(charged_datetime) as month_charge, YEAR(charged_datetime) as year_charge FROM billing

JOIN clients ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id

GROUP BY clients.client_id, month_charge, year_charge

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, GROUP_CONCAT(domain_name SEPARATOR ' / ') as sites FROM clients

JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id

GROUP BY clients.client_id;
